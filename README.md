Project Details

Feature I want to build is having a random screenshot generation on a page with 
endless scrolling. Clicking on a random given screenshot will take you to the game details page, this gives a nostalgic yet modern discovery feeling to it. Could maybe do this for all sections for the app, or pagination. Perhaps I should look at the library
first.
Can possibly use Framer Motion React library for this seamless transition scroll.
screenshots stored to IGDBs CDN amazon cloud server enables this, as load times latency issues shouldn't be an issue.

Built using twitch IGDB API: https://www.igdb.com/api 

Maybe add price chart data after developing (API price options like PriceCharting.com, costs $)

BACKEND directory:

Image size docs: https://api-docs.igdb.com/#reference

Cache Image responses (screenshots): https://api-docs.igdb.com/#images

I plan to cache a catalog of games storing lots of the more popular,
upon user search if game not in db hit IGDB API for request. Cover images and screenshots 


while results isn't null


pseudo:
 - save by year/platform route post requests 
 - json data recieved
 - await save games
 - iterate through games function to map to new obj
 - map function awaits getCover for url
 - getCover: if game has cover ID, request cover data to return
 - in createController create cover for foreign cover table


# PERN-Starter-Template
Starter template, using PERN stack, keeping backend and frontend in seperate directories. 


Commands:
Commands in BACKEND directory!
npm install (installs all dependencies found in package.json)

npm install supertest --save-dev (for testing) (scripts in package.json)


PRISMA:
npm install prisma --save-dev
npm install @prisma/client
npx prisma init  (makes prisma folder)
npm install @quixo3/prisma-session-store  https://github.com/kleydon/prisma-session-store#readme   (set up Session Model in Prisma)

 ----------------------------------------------------------------------
FRONTEND directory:

Design: Keep CSS inline or modular

npm install - sets up all node modules (installs all dependencies)

npm run dev - starts vite server

If using React to setup up default frontend directory run: 
npm create vite@latest . -- --template react


This template uses Prisma ORM supporting PostgreSQL. 
Prisma Setup Guide: https://www.prisma.io/docs/getting-started/setup-prisma/start-from-scratch/relational-databases-node-postgresql 
or use quick commands: 
 ---> npx prisma init  (then after adding DATABASE_URL to .env)  ---> npx prisma migrate dev --name init  ---> npx prisma generate

Don't forget to setup .env where variables such as DATABASE_URL(where data is being served) will go
.gitignore has .env and /generated/schema to ignore from public 

Using PostMan Web Agent (for full API functionality): https://learning.postman.com/docs/getting-started/installation/installation-and-updates/#install-postman-on-linux   (after installing with snap command, just run 'postman' as a command to launch)
